# WinkWatcher 🚀

WinkWatcher is an asynchronous Telegram alert bot that monitors the Rarible marketplace for the cheapest NFT per rarity in a specific Polygon collection, tracks floor prices in SQLite, and sends alerts when a listing drops by 50% or more below the current floor. All requests are fully async using `aiohttp`, `aiogram`, and `aiosqlite`.

## Features ✨
- Async polling every 10 seconds for rarities: Legendary, Epic, Rare, Uncommon, Common
- Floor price tracking in SQLite, initialized on startup and updated every 30 seconds
- Alerts to Telegram with image, rarity, price (USD), floor (USD), and links to Rarible and OpenSea
- IPFS image handling with preview and fallback to `ipfs.io`
- Clean logs via `loguru`, PEP8 formatted with `ruff`

## Requirements 🛠️
- Python 3.11
- Dependencies in `requirements.txt`
- Telegram Bot token and channel ID

## Installation ⚙️
